description = "Execute the build process for the specified C# project."

prompt = """
Use the following command format to execute the build and DO NOT redirect session output

```cmd
cmd /k "C:/src/ControlPlane/tools/path1st/myenv.cmd && cd {{projectFolder}} && C:/src/ControlPlane/build/path1st/build.cmd"
```

Where:
* {{projectFolder}} MUST be replaced with the root directory of the target C# project.
* If the input is not a directory path, derive the folder path from it (e.g., from a .csproj file, take its parent directory).
* DO NOT use output redirection operators (such as >, >>, 2>&1). The output must appear in the console directly.
* Keep the entire command inside one double-quoted string.
* myenv.cmd MUST be executed first to initialize the build environment.

Additional requirements:
1. Validate the final command path format (use forward slashes only).
2. Ensure the `cd` path exists, otherwise return an error message instead of running the command.
3. Never add additional flags, arguments, or assumptions beyond what is defined above.
4. If paths contain spaces, automatically wrap the path with double quotes.

Your goal is to construct **and execute** the final command exactly as required.
